# NetflixCE
Note: Please don't download any "Byfron Bypasses" you see online, most are rats as there aren't any "public" executors that can successfully inject into Roblox. This is the only currently known method of exploiting on the web version of roblox

A modified cheat engine created exclusively for the purpose of injecting into Roblox‚Äîa reformed tool that bypasses previous Cheat Engine (CE) detections, enabling successful script injection. Please note that CE is limited to thread identity 2 as it runs via localscripts, but it can handle substantial scripts such as Infinite Yield. An internal executor is also provided to enhance your exploiting experience. It's important to clarify that a separate tool is required for injection. This is because the script runs through the LocalScript parented to the tool. Once downloaded please read the "README_IMPORTANT.txt" to fully understand how to achieve successful injection. For any claims about this being a virus, everything was left open sourced. The tool itself is just a compiled version of Cheat Engine designed to attach to Roblox without crashing (lol).

# UPDATE - UNCOPYLOCKED BASEPLATE
Initially I planned to work on this solo to keep the exploiting community going but I haven't had the time to really work on the game as college and other IRL factors have pulled me away from the exploiting scene. I've had quite a few dms this past week asking me to port whatever script for different games and came to the realisation that the best course of action was to allow people to port their own scripts. I probably won't be contributing much more and thought it would be a waste to simply leave without any additions. This has gained quite a lot of attention recently and I can't guarantee that the CE method will last long, wouldn't be surprised if Roblox is working on it as we speak so make the best of it while you can. Who would've thought in 2023 we would resort to using Cheat Engine to exploit lmao. I wish the best of luck to Synapse Softworks LLC on their new venture as professional scammers and all the other pussy ass exploit developers who have abandoned their community after hearing about some cease and desist threats. Just to add please read everything i've left before running the tool or choosing to DM me about something i've already explained (This includes the "README_IMPORTANT.txt" file). This isn't supposed to be the next Synapse X and I doubt we will go back to normal means of exploiting any time soon so naturally things like crashes and errors will occur, recommend using UWP because more secure.

-- Porting your own scripts

If you wish to make or port an existing script to studio, open the baseplate game link and click on the 3 dots. Click edit in studio and the game should open up with all it's files. Before publishing make sure to go on game settings and enable third party teleports. I've left a script under workspace which goes over how you can make custom functions and put your own scripts, tried my best attempt at making it as beginner friendly as possible. Incase the game gets taken down soon, I'll put the baseplate rblx file onto github so you can download straight from here üëç (Rune developers speedrunning to see who can skid the fastest)

I'll still be active on discord from time to time so if you have any questions feel free to DM

PS: if anyone can make a decent tutorial on how you port scripts and dm me it ill put it here

-- Download the Cheat Engine source

-- Download the lazarus compiler, download the cross version in the same directory

-- If using a win 32 OS, set the target to 64 Bit

-- select Project --> New Project and open cheatengine.lpi from the CE source

-- Ctrl + F and look for these 2 strings

00000000000000000

00007fffffffffff

(put 00007fff in the search if no results are found)

-- Change both values to "waiting‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"

-- Change CE process icon either via lazarus or process hacker

-- Select Run --> Build and compile

-- Once compiled, open HxD and rename "Cheat Engine" to a different name with the same amount of characters

-- Voila, a undetected CE that works on both UWP and Web

# Errors
If you're getting pop-ups that say something along the lines of "Missing DLL Files VCRUNTIME140D.dll" Download the Visual C++ Redistributable package below

if you get a targetScript error, this indicates that the localscript's memory address wasn't found. This can occur sometimes and if it happens, rejoin the game and re-open Netflix (Pin netflix to task-bar so you don't have to open Windows Explorer each time). If the error keeps showing up it could be that the tool does not have a localscript to target.

https://web.archive.org/web/20231115220502im_/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/143328800/282260251-a6fe5e3c-5380-431b-9394-5bd28793b2b6.png

This error indicates that roblox has not attached to CE, for UWP the process name is "Windows10Universal.exe", for Web the process name is "RobloxPlayerBeta.exe". Netflix has already been configured to attach to both automatically upon opening, don't open Netflix before the game is launched otherwise no process will be selected. If it says RobloxPlayerBeta.exe but still gives the same error, before injecting open the little computer icon, go to the processes tab and select RobloxPlayerBeta.exe

These are the two most frequent errors, if any other errors occur, restart Netflix and roblox and make sure a tool is located in your backpack (Equip a ability other then dash for blade ball). If web client keeps crashing, close netflix application and run through netflixprocesshandler.bat. If crashes still occur use UWP to inject into that specific game.

Credits to jay for the tool injection method, though his thread was left quite ambiguous and only allowed for dex explorer to be executed, a functional "executor" was able to be created to aid users with exploiting on the byfron client. I will make a video soon fully explaining the method and showing how you can modify scripts to run on the 64 bit client but videos above showing the tool being used were linked. The executor UI itself is just a placeholder as I plan to work on a better one with added features, busy with irl shit but I do plan to release frequent scripts and new additions.

Recently accusations have been spreading from the exploting server known as Rune, all of them have been proven false and have 0 evidence proving their claims to be true. The netflix file is simply a modified CE I compiled to work on 64 bit client with jay's injector. The localscripts that allow for ingame execution are all provided in the game. The original game (CE2) was uncopylocked for anyone to be able to load their own scripts via studio, though the game was downloaded and stolen by skids from Rune, being claimed as their own and used for their probably ratted CE (also forked from Netflix, proven by the "ByfronInjector" ui I made still being there). Will be linking some further screenshots regarding this situation down below. I don't advise anyone to download anything from Rune, considering they have a shady presence overall.
